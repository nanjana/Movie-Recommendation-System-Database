# Movie-Recommendation-System-Database
Project Overview
This project is a Movie Database Management System designed to manage and query a dataset of movies, actors, directors, genres, and user ratings. The project demonstrates the implementation of a relational database system using SQL and includes various database operations such as data retrieval, data aggregation, and analysis. Additionally, the project features data visualization using Tableau, showcasing key insights from the movie industry, such as trends, ratings, and performance over time.

### Features
Database Design: Designed a normalized database schema with relationships between movies, actors, directors, genres, and ratings.
1. SQL Queries: A variety of SQL queries were written to retrieve and analyze data (e.g., top-rated movies, most popular directors, movie genre trends).
2. Data Visualization: Created interactive reports and visualizations using Tableau to analyze movie performance, trends, and ratings over time.
3. ETL Pipeline: Implemented an ETL process to load and clean data, ensuring smooth integration into the database.
4. Data Analysis: Analyzed user rating data to generate insights into trends, top movies by rating, genre performance, and director success.

### Tools & Technologies
1. SQL: PostgreSQL for database management and querying.
2. Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
3. Python: For data cleaning and preparation.
4. Kaggle Dataset: Movie dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset].

### Project Structure
1. SQL/: Contains the SQL scripts for database schema creation, data insertion, and queries.
2. schema.sql: Defines the database schema (tables, relationships, constraints).
3. insert_data.sql: SQL queries to insert data into the tables.
4. queries.sql: Various analytical queries for data retrieval and insights.
5. Visualizations/: Contains reports and dashboards created in Power BI/Tableau.
6. movie_dashboard.twbx: Power BI/Tableau files for data visualization.

### Key Insights & Visualizations
1. Top 10 Highest Rated Movies: Analyzed user ratings to identify the top 10 movies.
2. Most Popular Genres Over Time: Analyzed the number of movies produced in each genre per year.
3. Top Directors by Average Movie Rating: Visualized directors with the highest average movie ratings.

### Future Enhancements
1. Add user recommendations based on ratings.
2. Implement genre-based filtering in visualizations.
3. Integrate machine learning models to predict movie success based on past data.
